# Project Title

### Problem

The Business would be to incease the customer satisfaction by creating a travel booking platform that can predict the potential problem of flight delay. This information will allow the valuable customer to plan there trip ahead of time and stop weasting there time and help avoid inconveniences. The business goal is to accurately predict delays at the busiest domestic airports in the USA.

Solution and metrics to measere 
 
The key metrics would be F1-score as it shows the balances between precision and recall. 
This problem is a classification task since we are trying to predict a binary outcomeâ€”whether or not a flight will be delayed. Machine learning is appropriate here because of the large historical dataset is available, which allows us to identify patterns and build a predictive model for future flights.
